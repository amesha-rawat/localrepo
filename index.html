    <!-- we use, mkdir reponame -- this command to make directory -->

    <!-- then we use, git init -- this command is used to create a new git repo -->

    <!-- clear this command is used to clear the terminal -->

    <!-- git remote add origin <-link-> this used to add a remote repo which we gave default name origin -->

    <!-- git remote -v is used to verify remote -->

    <!-- git branch -- this is to check on which branch we are -->

    <!-- git branch -M main -- this is used to rename the branch -->

    <!-- git push origin main
     
    we can also write it as 
    git push -u origin main
    this -u means to set upstream that if for a longtime we want to work only on one project then we don;t have to use origin main again and again that's why we declare for once and all that we are working on origin main only by this -->
